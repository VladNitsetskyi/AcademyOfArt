      We convert our minds into bits and extend memories, thoughts, and
      perceptions beyond biological bodies to algorithmically mediated objects,
      databases, and networks. Our brains adapt to the tools that we use.
      Melting boarder of neuroscience and technology raises the emergence of a
      new space where AI and human brain learn from each other. Today artificial
      neural networks play an unseen and crucial role in our digital ecosystem
      by defining and recommending what should be seen, listened and read.
      Within the current Machine Learning Revolution, so-called GANs are trained
      on huge datasets of images, sounds, and texts and can create non-human
      realistic patterns. This project consists of a speculative video
      installation about the machine processing recall of human memories and a
      3-phase interview with the Machine Learning inventor Ian Goodfellow,
      futurist and tech-philosopher Gray Scott, professor for cognitive
      neuroscience Guillen Fernandez, computational neuroscientist Marco Aqil,
      artist and programmer Gene Kogan, artist and educator Tivon Rice, creative
      technologist Tomo Kihara, and creator of the generative design tools Joel
      Simon.;
